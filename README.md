# A NYU Computer Science Blog: [BURN RATE](https://blog.torchnyu.com/)

So I actually met the author of thiss website, and I find him really interesting. He's quite accomplished as an NYU CS student and I learned a lot from him in regards to React and just good practices. It's really a great resource for all NYU CS students, so I would highly reccomend to others.
